    A group of consecutive statements with the same indentation.
body
    The block of statements in a compound statement that follows the header.
boolean expression
    An expression that is either true or false.
boolean function
    A function that returns a boolean value. The only possible values of the bool type are False and True.
boolean value
    There are exactly two boolean values: True and False. Boolean values result when a boolean expression is evaluated by the Python interepreter. They have type bool.
branch
    One of the possible paths of the flow of execution determined by conditional execution.

comparison operator
    One of the operators that compares two values: ==, !=, >, <, >=, and <=.
condition
    The boolean expression in a conditional statement that determines which branch is executed.
conditional statement

logical operator
    One of the operators that combines boolean expressions: and, or, and not.
modulus operator
    An operator, denoted with a percent sign ( %), that works on integers and yields the remainder when one number is divided by another.
nesting
    One program structure within another, such as a conditional statement inside a branch of another conditional statement.
